*   **BLoC State Management:** Follows the BLoC pattern for predictable and scalable state management.
*   **MVVM Architecture:** A clean separation of concerns between the UI (View), business logic (ViewModel/BLoC), and data (Model).
*   **Declarative Navigation:** Uses `go_router` for a robust and type-safe routing solution.
*   **Local Data Source:** Parses a local `mock.json` file to populate the UI.
*   **Polished & Reusable UI:** Built with reusable widgets, a custom theme, and a well-organized project structure.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Flutter SDK 3.35.4
*   Dart 3.9.2

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Compatibility Note

The assignment required using **`better_player: ^0.0.84`**. This version is incompatible with modern Android Gradle builds and will cause a build failure due to a missing `namespace` declaration in its native Android configuration.

**Solution Implemented:** Instead of upgrading the package, the library's source files were **manually patched** to resolve the issue while adhering to the specified version.

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yashchaudhari109/flick_tv.git
    cd flick_tv
    ```

2.  **Get dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

### Building the APK
